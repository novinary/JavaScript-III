/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding - the value of 'this' will be the window/console Object
     in global scope
* 2. Implicit (automatic) Binding - the value of 'this' will be the object prior to the dot when a 
     function is called by a preceeding dot
* 3. New Binding - the value of 'this' will be the specific object that was created by 
     the constructor 
* 4. Explicit(forced) Binding - when .call, .apply or .bind is used the value of 'this' 
     will be explicitly defined by what the method is calling upon
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
